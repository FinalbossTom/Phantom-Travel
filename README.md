# Phantom Travel [Phantrels]
A Minecraft Datapack, that allows for travelling on set routes with phantoms.

Allows the player to set invisible Checkpoints anywhere in the World, to then transport a player autonomally through those previously placed Points.  
The Goal was to recreate a common Feature found in many MMORPGs, which lets players travel in a similiar way.

My main intention with this project was to learn a bit more about vectors/vectoring as well as doing pathfinding right, while doing all of this in a rather limited set, thus in form of a minecraft Datapack.
