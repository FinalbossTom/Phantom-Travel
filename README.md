# Phantom Travel | short: Phantrels
A Minecraft Datapack, that allows for travelling on set routes with phantoms.

Nothing too special, it's a datapack that can be used by running the "Movementmaster" function in a commandblock.
You are then able to create routes with checkpoints as well as creating Phantoms that follow these points.

It's not nearly finished yet, however i wanted to upload this for safekeeping.

My main intention with this project was to learn a bit more about vectors/vectoring as well as doing pathfinding right, while doing all of this in a rather limited set, thus in form of a minecraft Datapack.
